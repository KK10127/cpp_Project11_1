/*
 * Design a class Numbers that can be used to translate whole dollar amounts in
 * the range 0 through 9999 into an english description of the number. For example,
 * the number 713 would be translated into the string "seven hundred thirteen" and
 * 8203 would be translated into eight thousand two hundred three.
 *
 * The class should have a single integer member variable.
 *
 * int number;
 *
 * and a collection of statis string members that specify how to translate key dollar
 * amounts into the desired format. For example, you might use static strings such
 * as
 *
 * string lessThan20[ ] =
 *  { "zero", "one", "...", "eighteen", "nineteen" };
 * string hundred = "hundred";
 * string thousand = "thousand";
 *
 * The class should have a constructor that accepts a non-negative integer and uses it
 * to initialize the Numbers object. It should have a member function print() that prints
 * the English description of the Numbers object. Demonstrate the class by writing a main
 * program that asks the user to enter a number in the proper range and then prints out
 * its English description.
